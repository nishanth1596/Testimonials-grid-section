## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- **CSS GRID**:Gained a deeper understanding of using CSS Grid to create responsive layouts by adjusting grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows.

- **Flexbox**: Deepened my understanding of using Flexbox to create responsive layouts. Even though the page is desktop-first, Flexbox helped create a more flexible and modern layout.

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Worked with different CSS properties like margin, padding, and alignment to achieve a neat and well-spaced design.

### Continued Development

- **Optimizing for Mobile**: While the page was designed for desktop, I plan to experiment with adding basic media queries for mobile responsiveness in the future.

- **Adding JavaScript Interactivity**: I would also like to add some JavaScript functionality, such as a cooking timer or user-generated recipe submission forms.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
